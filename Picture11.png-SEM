(a) XRD patterns of LPBF-processed SDSS subjected to various heat treatments: As-printed (AS), Stress-Relieved
at 400°C/1h (SR400/1h), 450°C/1h (SR450/1h), 500°C/1h (SR500/1h), 550°C/1h (SR550/1h), and Solution Annealed
at 1100°C/15min (SA1100/15min). Characteristic peaks corresponding to ferrite (Fe-𝛼) and austenite (Fe-𝛾) phases
are identified; Corresponding SEM micrographs of LPBF-fabricated SAF 2507 on the XZ section (transverse to the
build direction; BD arrow) for each condition: (b) as-printed (AS); (c) stress-relieved at 400 ◦C/1 h (SR400/1 h); (d)
450 ◦C/1 h (SR450/1 h); (e) 500 ◦C/1 h (SR500/1 h); (f) 550 ◦C/1 h (SR550/1 h); (g) solution-annealed at 1100 ◦C for
15 min (SA1100/15 min).
